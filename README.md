# water-for-all

Greetings Team. My name is Steven Poulin. I studied at Bishops and now we are going to collaborate on a Nasa Project. Layachi told me times and times again, and I will tell you: Do projects like these, and coop programs. They will make the difference between being an amazon delivery driver or a programmer afterwards. Workplaces need experience. Even more than a degree. 

This said, let's start. 

This is our repository for the Space Apps 2020 challenge. Catherine is our project manager, Ahmad and I will be your guides for the coding part. You may very well know more than we do so we encourage you to speak up, show us what you can do and take charge of things you feel comfortable with. 

In a repository, we can work on things in parallel, separate the work. There is a master which is the project, then we pull out a clone on our own workspace, work on our part, then merge with the master, or a branch (which is a master in a parallel dimension).

GIT CHEAT SHEET : https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

Since we don't learn everything at Bishop's, online tutorial and online courses are great. 

Brad Traversy on youtube is pretty awesome. To learn html, css, javascript, frameworks like react and vue, and much else. He is now in a sabatical and has hired helpers, so dig down in his videos to find him.

We will update this readme to concern only the web app use and the code afterwards, as README files are meant for this.
